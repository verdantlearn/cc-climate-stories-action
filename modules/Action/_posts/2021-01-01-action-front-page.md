# Climate Action

## Action

What action are you taking to tackle the climate crisis?


**Lorenzo Ci**, *Activist/Filmmaker based in Florence, Italy.*
>I've always used storytelling as a tool to connect with other people. Inspired by several examples I came across in the years before I started to act on the local community, around the Florence City area. I launched a *Transition Town*, inspired by the international Transition network [https://transitionnetwork.org], inviting my town to invent together solutions to climate change problems. Now the community works very well, check it out at [www.valdisieveintransizione.org], it's all distributed in *Creative Commons! :D*

**Curt Newton**, *Boston*
> Do (at least) one thing on climate change every day. A conversation with someone you bump into definitely counts. :green_heart:

> Facilitate group conversations about what matters and what works, using the Climate Interactive En-ROADS simulation model [https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/en-roads/] 

> This simple Venn Diagram from Dr. Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson is a fabulous resource for "I want to do something, not sure what..." conversations [https://www.instagram.com/p/CMrzjtVHu0U/]
