## Using images

While Markdown supports adding images, its capacities for media are generally limited. Fortunately, Markdown is designed to support and work alongside HTML, which has vast options for customizing your course content with images, videos, and other interactive features

### Internal images (stored in your repo)

Place your image in the `img` folder, and link to it with the code below, replacing `logo.png` with the name of your image.

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/src/img/logo.png)

Centered image:
<center><img src="/src/img/preview-changes.png" alt="screenshot of github's Preview Changes function" width="75%"/></center>

<br>

?Right-justified image? **Doesn't work**
<right><img src="/src/img/preview-changes.png" alt="screenshot of github's Preview Changes function" width="75%"/></right>

### Images from the web
If you're using an image that is already uploaded somewhere, you can copy the URL and use it like in the example below:

```
![alt text for image](https://www.p2pu.org/assets/images/p2pu-logo.png)
```

![alt text for image](https://www.p2pu.org/assets/images/p2pu-logo.png)
