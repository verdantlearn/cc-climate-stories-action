## Using links

### Links within a page

Enable kramdown's *auto_ids* feature in `_config.yml` to give each heading an id ref based on the heading text:

```ruby
kramdown:
    auto_ids: true
```

Link to a heading from within the same document by using the auto-generated anchor, for example:

> Find out how to link to other pages by visiting the [Links to other pages](#links-to-other-pages) section

You can assign an explicit id if you prefer:

> To learn how to include emojis, see the [Emojis section](#emoji) below


### Links to other pages
To link to another page within the site, use a liquid tag:

View the info page on [embedding videos]({% link modules/embed/_posts/2000-01-03-video.md %}) in the Embed module

> This doesn't seem to work on subsites, where courses are subdirectories of main Github page!


### Emojis
{: #emoji }

Add the following to your site's _config.yml

```yaml
plugins:
  - jemoji
```

Then activate the Jemoji gem by adding this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jemoji'
```

Some examples of emojis:  
- :lion: `:lion:`
- :tiger: `:tiger:`
- :scream_cat: `:scream_cat:`
- :persevere: `:persevere:`
- :heart: `:heart:`
