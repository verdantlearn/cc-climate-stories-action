## Working with drafts

There are three ways of working with draft pages:
1. **Published tag** in yaml front matter
2. **Future-dated** posts
3. **Drafts** folder

## Published tag
> This method is most suitable when you want to keep submodules hidden while you are drafting them, and then make them visible manually when they are ready for consumption

Add a *published* tag to your yaml front matter, and set it to false:

```yaml
published: false
```

To preview your site locally, you can specify --unpublished

```bundle exec jekyll serve --unpublished```

When you want to make the post to live, delete the published flag from the yaml front matter, or set it to true.


## Future-dated posts
> This method is most suitable for drafting a course or blog posts that you want to automatically publish on a certain date 

Create a markdown file containing a date in the future in its file name.

Make sure that you have following setting in your _config.yml file. This will hide future dated posts from your live blog.

```yaml
future: false
```

To preview your site locally, you can specify --future

```bundle exec jekyll serve --future```

Both of the above options can be used in concert:

```bundle exec jekyll serve --unpublished --future```

## Drafts folder
This method is not convenient for use in Course-in-a-Box, as you'd either need a drafts folder for every module, or you'd need to drag & drop files from your single drafts folder into the correct module, which might be hard to identify.
