# Using Markdown

We'll be using a simple language called Markdown to format our collaboratively-created resources

Markdown allows you to format text simply by prefacing or surrounding your text with special characters


## Headings

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

normal font
```

## Adding emphasis

```
**bold**
*italics*
> Quote
```

## Lists

```
1. Numbered list
2. Second item in list

- Bullet points

- [ ] Task with checkbox
- [ ] Completed task
```

## Links

1. Surround your text with square parentheses []
2. Place the url immediately after (no space between), within round parentheses () 

Example: [This session on Sched](https://sched.co/lhJQ)

```
[This session on Sched](https://sched.co/lhJQ)
```

## Images

1. Preface your image link with an exclamation mark
2. Enter the alt text surrounded by square parentheses []
3. Append the url surrounded by round parentheses ()
