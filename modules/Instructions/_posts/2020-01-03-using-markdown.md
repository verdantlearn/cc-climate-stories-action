# Using Markdown
{:.no_toc}

We'll be using a simple language called Markdown to format our collaboratively-created resources

Markdown allows you to format text simply by prefacing or surrounding your text with special characters

- TOC
{:toc}

## Headings

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## Adding emphasis

Example:
```
**bold**  
```
Looks like this: **bold**  

Example:
```
*italics*  
```
Looks like this: *italics*  

Example: 
```
> Quote
```
Looks like this:  
> Quote


## Lists
Examples:  
```
1. Numbered list
2. Second item in list

- Bullet points

- [ ] Task with checkbox
- [x] Completed task
```
Looks like this:  
1. Numbered list
2. Second item in list

- Bullet points

- [ ] Task with checkbox
- [x] Completed task


## Links

1. Surround your text with square parentheses []
2. Place the url immediately after (no space between), within round parentheses () 


Example:

```
[This session on Sched](https://sched.co/lhJQ)
```
Looks like this: [This session on Sched](https://sched.co/lhJQ)


## Images

1. Preface your image link with an exclamation mark
2. Enter the alt text surrounded by square parentheses []
3. Append the url surrounded by round parentheses ()

Cryptpad may block display of external images, but once our shared work is imported to Course-in-a-Box, your image will display properly

Example, including image credit as link:

## Embed from other pages

Copy the embed code from the source website and paste it into the document.  Cryptpad may block display of external media, but once our shared work is imported to Course-in-a-Box, your media will display properly


## Troubleshooting

If your formatting doesn't work, or your text doesn't separate itself into paragraphs, try adding two spaces after each line
