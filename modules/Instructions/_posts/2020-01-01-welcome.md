## Hackathon description

Our ability to tackle the climate crisis depends on our individual context, the limits of our knowledge, and how empowered we feel to create change.  What matters is not necessarily the precise actions we take, but that we form aspirations, start somewhere, collaborate to shift the paradigm, and thus propel ourselves and others into further action.  We can only succeed by sharing our knowledge and educating ourselves on how to have the greatest impact, both on the climate, and on our ability to sustain and extend hopeful action into the future 

As participants in this hackathon, you are invited to:
1. Share how the climate crisis is directly affecting you, your loved ones, or your wider community.  You can tell your story in whatever medium resonates with you (text, images, audio, video, interactive data visualisation), provided it can be embedded on a web page!
2. Tell us what actions you are taking individually or collectively to help mitigate climate change, be they small steps or seismic changes, hyper-local or with international impact
3. Tell us what actions you want to take (again individually or collectively) but haven't done so yet, and what is holding you back
4. Compile existing projects and openly-licenced resources that can feed into the output from this hackathon
5. Share your knowledge of multi-media repositories and open source software we can use to capture and embed the variety of contributions
6. Collaborate to select an appropriate licence and citation that recognises the contributions of all, and maximises the potential for re-use

A brief introductory workshop will explain how to document your contributions so they can be combined into an online resource.  Contributions can be added asynchronously throughout the summit.  The final stage of the hackathon will be a live demonstration of how to convert this collaboratively-created content into an interactive resource (the seed of an online course) using P2PU's Course-in-a-Box
