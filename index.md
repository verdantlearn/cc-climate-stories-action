This online resource is being created during the Creative Commons Global Summit 2021 to document:
- **Stories**: Our community's lived experience of climate change, and
- **Action**: How we are reducing our own carbon footprint, and leveraging change around us

See the session joining information <a href="https://sched.co/lhJQ">here</a>

Our focus is on optimism and empowerment, sharing inspiration and ideas for positive, achievable action at this critical point in time.  This community is uniquely placed to combine and disseminate our knowledge in a way that is accessible, inclusive and grounded in everyday life
