This online resource is being created during the Creative Commons Global Summit 2021

As a community, we will document:
- **Stories**: Our lived experience of climate change, and
- **Action**: How we are reducing our own carbon footprint, and leveraging change around us

Our focus is on **optimism and empowerment**, sharing inspiration and ideas for positive, achievable action at this critical point in time.  This community is uniquely placed to combine and disseminate our knowledge in a way that is accessible, inclusive and grounded in everyday life

You can **navigate** through this resource using the menu bar at the top of this page
