# Course-in-a-Box template
Lucy Tallents, VerdantLearn

Course-in-a-Box is a free tool for building and publishing online courses â€” no prior coding experience required.

To create a new course, simply duplicate this template repo (CNAME has already been deleted). Detailed documentation is available at [course-in-a-box.p2pu.org](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org).

To make changes to the template itself, a good place to start is the [`_layouts`](/_layouts), [`_includes`](/_includes) and [`css`](/css) directories. These directories contain all the layout and style files used.
